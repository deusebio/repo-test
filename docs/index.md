## Charmed MongoDB K8s Documentation 

The Charmed MongoDB Operator delivers automated operations management from day 0 to day 2 on the [MongoDB Community Edition](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo) document database running on Kubernetes. It is a very great open source, end-to-end, production-ready data platform on top of juju.

MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database application. It stores its data with JSON-like documents creating a flexible experience for users; with easy to use data aggregation for data analytics. It is a distributed database, so vertical and horizontal scaling come naturally.

The Charmed MongoDB Operator meets the need of deploying MongoDB in a structured and consistent manner while allowing the user flexibility in configuration. It simplifies deployment, scaling, configuration and management of MongoDB in production at scale in a reliable way.
